<h1>IIIF Viewers</h1>

This page is a test if a "viewer.html" can be initialized one - with first documnent on which user clicks, and then by additional clicking on another documents these can be loaded in the running single instance of a viewer, without reloading it. 
It seems it runs. Try it:
  
<h2>Documents</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="viewer.html#document1" target="viewername">document1</a>
<li><a href="viewer.html#document2" target="viewername">document2</a>
<li><a href="viewer.html#document3" target="viewername">document3</a>
</ul>
